I plan on testing study 3 of Stancato and Keltner's 2021 experimental study because its in line with my research interests in polarization, and the study has insights into the emotional mechanisms by which ideological ridgidity takes place. I think this study 3 is a bit sketchy (p values approaching p =.05, short writing experimental prime etc.) I think the idea that thinking about nature for a minute or two will shape people's attitudes on politics and their political opponents is equal parts interesting and unlikely. Given their p values were hovering around p .05, I'd like to probe a little more into these data. 
Stimuli: I'll replicate the Study 3 experimental prime with complete fidelity to the original version, giving participants a chance to reflect on prototypical pride, awe, and neutral experiences. Also included will be a short three item measure of immigration attitudes and Stancato and Keltner's social distance measure of partisan hostility - 10 different completions to the sentence stem “I would be happy to have someone who did not share my views on immigration . . .”. Sentence completions will consist of various relationship types (e.g., “as a neighbor,” “as someone I would personally date”).. 
A challenge of this project will be learning how to conduct the analysis using the bootstrapping procedure for mediator models with 10,000 iterations. I have yet to use bootstrapping procedures in my analyses.
